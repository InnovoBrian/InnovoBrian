- 👋 Hi, I’m @InnovoBrian
- 👀 I’m interested in crypto and smart contracts.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning solidity and python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to lern more about smart contracts and real world adoption.
- 📫 Contact me on GitHub if there is anything, would love to speak to real smart contract developers!
- 😄 Currently living in Norway, where we live on oil.
- ⚡ What i want: I want to make it big some day in this space, to have my own team to make more workplaces and help the world connect with crypto, blockchain and smart contracts!
- 🤗 I just started learning about this so any help is greatly appreciated!
